                <p>In 2003, I co-founded Octane Coffee, with humble beginnings on the Westside of Atlanta. Knowing very little about the coffee industry, but always having the passion to learn and believe in what was possible, the idea of a single coffee shop grew to be a thriving coffee business and community hub with 8 business units. I co-owned and co-operated the company from itâ€™s infancy to April 2017.</p>

                <p>In 2015, co-working spaces in Atlanta were relatively unknown, but very much in need. Through a partnership between myself and three others, Elevator Factory was born. I helped lead a team of designers and builders to transform an empty shell into a beautiful co-working and event space.</p>
